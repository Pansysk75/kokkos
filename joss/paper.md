# Summary


# Statement of need

# Applications

Kookos is used in the following applications:

* Trilinos
* he Flexible Computational Science Infrastructure (FleCSI) is an open-source C++ framework to assist in the development of performance portable multiphysics applications leveraging different task-based run-times, such as Legion or HPX (@Kaiser2020), and making use of Kokkos to offload work to CPU threads and GPUs of all major vendors (@10.1007/978-3-031-06156-1_38).
* Please add name, put BibTex entry in papper.bib, and cite it here.

# Example code

* Show numerical integration using parallel_reduce
