abstract="The FleCSI 2.0 programming system supports multiphysics application development through a runtime abstraction layer, and by providing core topology types that can be customized for specific numerical methods. The abstraction layer provides a single-source programming interface for distributed and shared-memory data parallelism through task and kernel execution, and has been demonstrated to introduce virtually no runtime overhead. FleCSI's core topology types represent a rich set of basic data structures that can be specialized to create application-facing interfaces for a variety of different physics packages. Using the FleCSI control and data models, it is straightforward to compose multiple packages to create full multiphysics applications. When used with a task-based backend, FleCSI offers extended runtime analysis that can increase task concurrency, facilitate load balancing, and allow for portability across heterogeneous computing architectures.",
